What are you doing to strengthen your mindset?

Do we get kicked in the shins every once in a while in this business? In other words, have you ever logged on to Facebook and saw a past client post about buying or selling a home without using you? If so, it probably stung a little bit. **If it didn’t, you should consider getting out of the business.&nbsp;**

You can do everything possible to minimize this type of occurence (stay top of mind, communicate with your database, etc.), but you can still end up getting squeezed out of a deal every so often.&nbsp;

As the old saying goes, “Garbage in, garbage out.” But I believe in the saying, “Garbage in, garbage stays.” If you want to strengthen your mindset, then, **tune the garbage out and surround yourself with positive influences.** Listen to motivational podcasts, for instance. Take stock of what you’re reading and who you’re surrounding yourself with. Jim Rome once said that you’re the average of the five people you spend the most time with, and I believe that if you hang out with nine top producers, you’re bound to be the 10th.&nbsp;

Life is going to drive you down sometimes, whether it’s because of your boss, your kids, your environment, etc., so use daily positive affirmations to build your mindset up. **If you’re interested in making the next 12 months your best 12 months, you have to do this** because it’s the foundation of being a successful agent and business owner.&nbsp;
