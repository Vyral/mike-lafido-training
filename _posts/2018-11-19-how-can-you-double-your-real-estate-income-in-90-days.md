Many agents are looking for that magic pill. However, success comes down to blocking and tackling those x’s and o’s. These are the three fastest ways you can double your income in the next 90 days as an agent or team leader:

**1. Increase the average sale price of a home you represent.** I think this is the easiest strategy. The goal for any agent that goes through our luxury listing specialist certification is to increase their average sale price by 30% in a year.

**2. Be more profitable per transaction.** This could include cutting away some fat from your marketing budget with methods that aren’t working. This could also include protecting your fee. If you bring enough value to the table, you shouldn’t have to compete by discounting what you charge. If you get really good at this and get your clients a higher list-to-sale ratio, you might be able to charge more than whatever the going rate is in your market.

**3. Increase your conversion rate.** If you’re converting five out of 10 listing appointments right now, that would put you in the hall of fame in the major leagues. However, in real estate, you should be doing much better than that. The more we can increase your conversion rate, the more listings you’ll get, and the more likely you are to get more money.
