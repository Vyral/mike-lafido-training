Today we’re discussing the gravity of event-based marketing at your luxury properties. Great marketing can make all the difference to your sale. You need to get high net-worth buyers through the home. The top 10% of homes in most markets are considered to be in a buyer’s market. You have to be creative to get influential people through the property and talking about the home. Event-based marketing is one of the ways you can do that.&nbsp;

**We just had an event at what Architectural Digest named the most beautiful home for sale in Illinois.** I’m privileged enough to represent this home. It’s the backdrop for the FOX TV series “Empire,” which is in its sixth and final season. This is the main character’s house in the show. (Check out the show “Empire,” you won’t be disappointed.) This home is listed for $9.5 million. We needed to get some action happening in this home.&nbsp;

So, we partnered with an exotic car club and made one of their road rallies make this home a stop on the rally tour. At 1:35 in the video above, you can view a few photos and videos from the event. We had 40 exotic cars valued well over $10 million: Lamborghinis, Ferraris, Maseratis, and various other cars. At this rally stop, we gave tours of the property, had high-end print materials available (36-page hardcover books), brochures, beverages, I gave a state-of-the-market speech, and we gave away prizes for games. **The owner was delighted with the event.**

This event was extremely well received by everyone in attendance. Indirectly with event-based marketing, you get people saying this is out-of-the-box, and this could lead to future business. Hopefully, this will lead to a sale of that “Empire” home. Whoever ends up with this property will also get the bragging rights of stating that their home was showcased on a popular TV series\!&nbsp;

With event-based marketing, don’t do the same things as everyone else—get creative. If you want, you can have an event strictly for real estate agents in the morning, have a break, then host an event for high net-worth individuals and influencers in the afternoon.&nbsp;

Continue to raise the bar in real estate\! Remember, as an agent, stay away from politics, even on social media. People in all major parties buy and sell large homes.&nbsp;
