How do you build your brand?

In previous videos, we talked about developing a unique selling proposition, but **today we’re talking about building a brand both online and offline.&nbsp;**

If someone Googles you and lands on one of your social media platforms, will the branding they see across each of these pages be consistent? That’s something you need to consider. If you’re not a big LinkedIn user, for example, but a potential client is and they go to your LinkedIn profile and see that it’s not optimized, you’ll lose your competitive advantage. Your offline brand, meanwhile, can include things like postcards and lead generation.&nbsp;

**To keep things consistent, try focusing on colors and logo.** Have some colleagues you like and trust analyze your brand and offer their thoughts on how you can improve things.&nbsp;

In the video above, you can see I’m wearing a shirt that says “Location. Location. Location.” This is just one of the clothing items we sell on our brand-new website **[LuxurySpecialistGear.com](https://luxury-specialist-gear.myshopify.com/){: target="_blank"}.** We’ve created different designs and color schemes for our all of our gear—that’s an example of how we build our brand.&nbsp;

Another example is our branded boxes we use to send people things in the mail, which has our slogan and logo stamped on the outside. If you work with a lot of expired and canceled listings, why not do something similar and use a branded box?&nbsp;

In any case, remember that consistency is key when building your brand.&nbsp;
