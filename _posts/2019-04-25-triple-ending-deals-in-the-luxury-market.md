Using pocket listings and coming-soon listings is a great way to create urgency and help your clients net more money. For the listing agent, this strategy may also lead to triple ending a deal. 

Why? Well, **you have a much higher chance of working with an unrepresented buyer with these kinds of deals—especially in the luxury market. **

As a reminder, a coming-soon listing is a home you haven’t yet put on the open market, but one that you’re marketing as being an up-and-coming option for local buyers. Consumers always want what they can’t have, which is exactly how coming-soon listings create such a sense of urgency among buyers.

Pocket listings, meanwhile, are homes that have been listed privately and never hit the MLS at all. 

As was mentioned earlier in this message, many buyers who seek these kinds of listings will forgo the representation of a buyer’s agent. **This gives you the opportunity to represent the buyer and the seller, and to potentially help the buyer sell their current home, as well.**
