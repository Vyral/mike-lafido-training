In the video above which is geared more towards real estate agents, you will see an amazing property that we are marketing right now at just under $3 million. It has some amazing features such as an indoor saltwater pool, but we wanted to make these features pop on camera and video.

**To do that, we decided to showcase some amazing artwork from IKONICK,** and these big canvas portraits are all over the property catching the eyes of buyers and their agents. &nbsp;This artwork company took several professional photo's and leveraged those photo's on social media which lead to an online spike in activity for this particular home.

As you can see, the art is visually stunning. Time is money, and with marketing like this, we decrease the time a luxury home spends on the market before selling. Adding this beautiful art to an already beautiful home really brings it all together and shows prospective buyers the unique features of the home by tying in the artwork.

As we’ve seen time and time again, marketing your luxury home properly will lead to more offers, higher offers, and a quicker sale. **I****t might take a bit of an investment, but that investment will be worth it when the deal is closed and you no longer have to worry about selling or even maintaining the property.**

If you have any questions for me about how to successfully market your home for sale, don’t hesitate to give me a call or sending me an email. I would love to hear from you soon.
