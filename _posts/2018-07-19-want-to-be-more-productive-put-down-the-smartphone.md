As a real estate agent, a team leader, and a broker-owner, being productive is essential to getting more out of your day and helping people buy and sell more properties.

How do you be more productive, though?

The first thing you should do is plan your day out. The night before, prioritize your schedule and focus on where you need to time-block.

Your real focus, though, should be something I call “MOLO”—what you can do more of, and what you can do less of to be more productive.

The first thing you need to do less of is **being on your smartphone.** Put the smartphone down and put it on mute. According to recent studies, the average smartphone user unlocks their phone 150 times a day. Checking your phone 150 times a day to see if someone texted you takes away from your focus. It only takes 2.2 seconds to unlock your smartphone, but if you’re in the middle of doing something productive, it takes an average of 11 minutes to regain the focus you had before you let your smartphone distract you. Many times, putting your smartphone out of sight helps even more.

I recently attended a Keller Williams Luxury conference where author Amy Blankson talked about her book “The Future of Happiness” and addressed the topic of how much time our smartphones take away from us. Here are a few statistics I learned:

* 77% of parents think their kids are addicted to their smartphones. As bad as that is, 41% of kids think their parents are addicted to their smartphones.
* 54% of people think it’s okay to check their smartphone during dinner.
* 57% of people think it’s okay to check their smartphone while they’re in the bathroom.
* 33% of people think it’s okay to check their smartphone during sex (don’t ask me how they came up with that number).

**If something like your smartphone is distracting you and taking your time away, you need to put it down and reclaim your focus.**

Many times, broker-owners and team leaders are also more productive when they close their office door because people are not always asking them about things they can probably figure out themselves. In fact, someone once told me that they put a sign up on their door that read “Stop, think about it, and go away.”

If you want to talk more about how you can be more productive or, if you have another topic in mind you would like to see me cover, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to speak with you.
