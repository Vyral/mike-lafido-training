We had a lot of things to be thankful for in 2018. We made great strides and continued to raise the bar in real estate both in general and for luxury real estate. We hosted 13 live Luxury Listing Specialists Certification classes this past year, from the east coast to down south, and even north to Canada. Overall, we had agents from 28 states represented.&nbsp;**With all our training and activities this past year, we<br>definitely racked up some frequent flyer miles.**

Beyond that, there were a few other points from 2018 that I’m excited to share with you:

* We formed a strategic alliance with “Who’s Who in Luxury Real Estate?”, and we were fortunate enough to present at both of their conferences. &nbsp;For more information, visit [www.LuxuryRealEstate.com](http://www.LuxuryRealEstate.com){: target="_blank"}
* In just the second half of the year, we certified 155 RE/MAX INTEGRA agents get LUXE certified. There are over 40,000 agents in total at RE/MAX INTEGRA. They have already booked us for two more live certification classes in 2019.
* We gave away over $50,000 in LUXE scholarships in 2018.
* We were also recognized by the International Property Awards as not only one of the best consulting businesses for agents looking to sell high-end properties in the United States,&nbsp; but also globally.

For us at the Luxury Listing Specialists, it was truly a great year, and we hope that yours was just as momentous.
