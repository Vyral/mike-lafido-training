What is the power of demonstration?

I could think of a few real-world examples. Imagine the last late-night infomercial you might have seen, or an episode of “Shark Tank.” I recently saw a commercial on ESPN about Flex Tape where a guy cut a hole in a boat, sealed it with the tape, and drove it over shark-infested waters just to show how strong the tape was. That’s an extreme example, but you get the point.

What does the power of demonstration mean when it comes to real estate? Where can you leverage the power of demonstration? Here are several examples my team uses:

**Video books.** As you know, if you pay attention to social media, video is not a fad. I was an early adopter of video, and many agents who carry our certification have our luxury listing specials video book. It has over two hours’ worth of material, and you can bring it with you to pre-networking meetings, listing appointments, or just show it to potential sellers when explaining why they should work with you. The video book exemplifies the theme of today’s message: Don’t just tell people what makes you different and unique—show them.

**Before-and-after books.** If you’re sitting across the kitchen table from a potential client, you’ll be able to use these to show them how you’ll position their home more effectively so a larger pool of buyers will inquire about it. In other words, you’re demonstrating to them that you understand what it takes to sell their home.

**Matched pair booklets.** If you’ve never heard of this term, it means taking similar properties in the same community—some of which have had no work done, and others which have had significant updates—and showing these properties to sellers to demonstrate that if they make some investments in their home, it will sell faster and for more money.

**Big pre-listing packages.** If you bring this to a listing appointment and plop it down on the table between you and the seller, that’s guaranteed to get their attention.

**Contributing an authorship.** Writing a book is the quickest way to attain authority in your marketplace. For example, I’ve written many books for both agents and the consumer, including “Marketing Luxury.”

**Two listing brochures.** If you’re meeting with a client, you can show them two listing brochures for their home—one of which showcases it as it currently is, while the other showcases it after it’s been updated.

**Third-party endorsements.** We’re the only certification that’s endorsed by Who’s Who in Luxury Real Estate.

**Analytics and data.** If you have data that will help you convince someone that you can sell their home faster and for more money, bring that data with you. If the seller is skeptical by nature, they’ll want to read it.

So, remember to always be raising the bar in your business, and, again, show people instead of telling them.
