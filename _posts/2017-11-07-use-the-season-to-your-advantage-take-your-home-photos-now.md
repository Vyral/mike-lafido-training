Today I’d like to talk about the importance of taking photos of the outside of your house now if you’re thinking of selling in the winter or the Spring of 2018.<br><br>If you want to sell your home in the spring as many sellers do, I recommend you get your exterior photos taken now while there are still some green leaves on the trees.<br><br>Recently, I was contacted by a homeowner that listed with another agent in March of 2017. Their contract was up, and they were unhappy with their agent, so they interviewed me. Taking a look at the photos they’d had, I noticed they hadn’t been updated from March when they were originally taken.**&nbsp;It was a gloomy day, and there were no leaves on the trees.**<br><br>Being proactive, I quickly had photos taken of the home with a drone, even though their home wasn’t going on the market right away. However, you only get one chance to make a first impression, so exterior photos are really important. If the exterior photos are drab and dreary, buyers may not want to see the photos of inside and ultimately move onto a different listing.

If your home isn’t currently on the market, or if it is but you plan to make changes to your listing, be proactive.**&nbsp;Interview your agents now, and take your photos now.**&nbsp;I talk about this among many other things in my new book “Luxury Listing Specialist”. This fall we attended many conferences where we were rubbing elbows with some of the top agents from around the world, so I could come back to my marketplace to serve my clients more effectively with cutting-edge marketing, both online and offline.<br><br>If you need a second opinion on your real estate transaction, you’re thinking of selling, or you have any real estate questions at all, please reach out to us.
