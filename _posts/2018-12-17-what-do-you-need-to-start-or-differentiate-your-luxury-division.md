If you’re looking to increase the number of high-end and luxury transactions for your office, team, or individual sales then having a strong luxury division is not optional.  What does a strong, dedicated luxury division look like, though?

The old way of starting, or unfortunately many brokers' current luxury divisions (which many franchises still ascribe to), is to just have a different logo for their luxury division or a luxury sign for their offices. That’s not a luxury division and that doesn't benefit the agents or the consumer.

The new way and true luxury division involves: better training and resources, **better-qualified agents, a dedicated luxury division website with only luxury listings, and, perhaps, a prerequisite for agents to quality to be listed as a luxury agent in your office.  Many of our clients require their agents have the Luxury Listing Specialist Certification (LUXE)** or another strong luxury certification before that agent can be listed on their luxury division directory or website. That’s what a strong luxury division is all about—giving your agents an advantage through better training and resources over other agents and brokerages in your area when selling high-end properties.
