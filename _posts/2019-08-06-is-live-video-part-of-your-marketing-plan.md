Today we’re going to talk about live videos and why you should be incorporating them into your business. I’m excited to show you some examples of how to create great content through live video platforms like Facebook Live and Instagram Live.

There are plenty of reasons that you should be using live video in your business, but **one of the most important ones is to differentiate yourself.** Jack Trout once wrote a book called “Differentiate or Die.” One way to differentiate yourself in this business is by creating content on different social media platforms. I’ve done 20 to 30 live trainings over the past few years and have been consistently putting video out.&nbsp;

I can tell you that about 20% of agents consistently do this, but that means 80% aren’t. I don’t want you to be in that 80%. **I want you to be in that 20% so you can attract more high net worth individuals and differentiate yourself from the competition.&nbsp;**

Another benefit is that it’s so easy to use. All you need is your phone and the Facebook app. Make sure your phone is vertical, type in your status, and click the “Go Live” button. Once you start the live video, you’re live for the world to see. Try a few practice runs before you actually go live. **I recommend a lot of energy, keep it short, and publish it to your wall and to your stories.&nbsp;**

What types of content can you create through this platform? **One idea is going live at an open house that advertises the home and the event.** You could also do a Facebook Live session with a happy client or a unique feature of your community. There are so many different ways to make great content through Facebook Live from a real estate perspective.

**Video is not a fad**. Fads come and go. Blockbuster and Toys R Us are examples of companies that didn’t adapt to the changes and fell by the wayside. However, video marketing is not a fad. It’s here to say.&nbsp;

Finally, I wanted to tell you about a great book that was released by the gentleman who started Bomb Bomb videos. **It’s called “Rehumanize Your Business” and has a lot of helpful insight into using video to grow your business.** I realize that some of you won’t create videos of your personal life and it might not be comfortable, but that’s where the magic happens. Good is good enough, and your authenticity will shine through to your followers. Keep raising the bar and prove them wrong.
