What’s the quickest way to gain credibility? We believe it’s through authorship, and today we’ll show you how you can become an author through our latest offering: **the Luxury Rockstar Package.**

With this package, we’ll provide our past book, “Market Luxury,” to one agent in each marketplace who will be allowed to claim authorship of it. You don’t have to write the book—**we’ve already done it for you.**

We’ll set up an interview after preparing you ahead of time with a list of questions. **We’ll record this interview and transcribe your information into the full book.** You can choose from three different options for your cover, as well as decide what pictures will be used for the book. Of course, your name will be on the front and back covers, as well.

With the package, you’ll receive 100 copies of your book and be coached one-on-one to get you started with the authorship process. After you have your book, we’ll give you information on how to leverage it in your career. On top of this, we’ll bring you onto our podcast as a guest contributor and, lastly, we’ll include our information for canceled and expired listings.

**If you’d like to take advantage of this opportunity to gain credibility through authorship**, reach out to us. We’d be happy to give you more information and answer any questions you may have. Remember to act quickly, though, as we can only extend this offer to one agent per marketplace. Until then, we look forward to hearing from you.
