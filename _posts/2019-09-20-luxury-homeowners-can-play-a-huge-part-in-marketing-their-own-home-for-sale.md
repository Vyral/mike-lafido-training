In this week’s article, we’re going to talk about how you can help your home sellers become the inside sales force for you to get the word out about their luxury listing. **If they can drive more traffic to your videos and photos online by sharing it via social media, that can be a huge benefit to your chances of selling for top dollar.**

We’ve talked before about circle prospecting and letting the neighbors of your listing know that they can help pick their next neighbor. **That same kind of concept works here too.** You have a gorgeous home, but working together with the seller to share the listing with their entire social circle, that’s huge.

Some sellers might be a little hesitant, but here’s the thing:&nbsp;**The day that the home is listed on the market, everyone will know it’s listed even if there’s no sign in front of the house.** We might as well leverage their databases to get more eyeball traffic and more qualified showings and offers. This might mean giving some extra brochure copies to your clients or creating a video book like you see in the video above. The seller can then have that video book out whenever people are over and let people know it’s on the market.

At the end of the day, you want that sign out in your yard to let everyone know the home’s available and so that it brings top-of-mind awareness. You also want to have your home sellers on board so they know how important they are in all of this.

I hope this was helpful. Don’t forget to leave us a review for our book on Amazon, subscribe to our YouTube channel, and listen to our podcast on iTunes and Stitcher.
