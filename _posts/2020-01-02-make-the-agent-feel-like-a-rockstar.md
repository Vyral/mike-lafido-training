To make the buyer’s agent feel like a rockstar, we give them everything they’ll need to get through the transaction on a silver platter ahead of time, including:

* The results of a favorable pre-appraisal
* The report from a pre-inspection that details all the preventative repairs the homeowner has done over the years
* Listing videos, such as those filmed via drones
* Video brochures
* Special feature sheets

**Our goal is to do anything we can to make the showing of one of our properties more memorable than the competition.** By default, we assume that the buyer’s agent is busy and doesn’t already have all this information ahead of time, so we’ll bring it all with us to the appointment. This will make them look like a great agent in front of their clients, which raises the bar to make the experience better for the buyer and their agent.
