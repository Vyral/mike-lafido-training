When it comes time to list a high-end or luxury property, event-based marketing is an extremely effective selling strategy.

High-end homes, defined as those valued at least two times the average sales price, and luxury homes, defined as those valued at least three times the average sales price, tend to be highly unique. With that being said, the marketing techniques one might use for a listing in a lower price range may not be sufficient.

**Wine and cheese tastings or broker open houses are fine, generally speaking, but for the kinds of properties we’re discussing today, an invite-only event may be even better.**

Take, for example, one amazing property currently on the market in Scottsdale, Arizona, for just over $6.5 million. The agents working on this listing, who I’ve been coaching for the last several months, have hosted a couple of events at the property so far. One of these events was an invite-only, two-day “Freedom Summit,” which we held on September 28 and September 29.

This event is a prime example of event-based marketing. The 90 agents who attended and the owner of the property mutually benefited from this educational summit, which was also attended by a number of preferred vendors and sponsors.

**Events of this calibur, though, do require a higher level of planning than what might be the case for an average open house.** In addition to orchestrating the event itself, the property’s owner will also need to guard themselves against liability and security concerns.

The primary benefit of event-based marketing is its superlative ability to draw exposure. The agents who attend will benefit from the networking opportunity the event provides, and the seller will also benefit from the buyer interest that is generated, in turn.
