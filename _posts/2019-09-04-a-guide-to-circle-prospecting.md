Suppose you have a listing, be it entry-level or high-end: What can you do to get the word out about it to the neighborhood?

That question essentially gets at the heart of what circle prospecting is—informing the neighborhood around the listing that the property has gone up for sale, and also leveraging that listing to get more buyers.

**In order to maximize the outcome of your circle prospecting, keep these tips in mind:**

1\. Send out a “Just Listed” postcard to your database, your sphere, and the neighborhood around the listing.<br>2\. Doorknock.<br>3\. Stuff mailboxes.<br>4\. Host an open house and send invitations out to the neighborhood.

For my part, I recently put a new property on the market at just under $1.2 million. **To get the word out, we put together little hardcover listing books.** They’re over 30 pages long and aren’t cheap, but we delivered those to the immediate neighbors around the property, saying, “Wouldn’t it be nice to pick your next neighbor?” Granted, these books are too large to fit in the actual mailbox, so we placed them at the base of the box to ensure that the neighbors see them. Mind you, having different options for print collateral may be in your best interest—you can have hardcover or softcover materials.

You could also try **creating a listing video brochure to post on your website.** That way, when you drive traffic toward your website, potential buyers and neighbors can go online to view it and share the listing with their friends, increasing the pool of people who are exposed to it.

Of course, **there is also the option of doing digital ads on Facebook or through companies like Adworks that target specific ZIP codes**.

In the end, the goal of your circle prospecting campaigns should be to differentiate yourself. Many sellers might circle back to you because they were so impressed at the way you handled their listing the first time.
