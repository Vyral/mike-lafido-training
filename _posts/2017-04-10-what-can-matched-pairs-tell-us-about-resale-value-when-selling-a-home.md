Matched pairs is a term you probably haven't heard of. If you’re thinking of selling your home, it’s always wise to consider making improvements and upgrades. &nbsp;However, you’ve got to know where to spend your money in order to get the highest possible return. **Recently, I had a client who spent about $20,000 on leaf guards that were nice but didn’t really add any value to his home.&nbsp;**

The first thing to do when selling your home is to consult a professional like myself who knows what they’re doing. That being said, it’s always best to do a few cosmetic improvements at least. For unique properties or properties where there aren’t a lot of comparables, we recommend an appraisal prior to going on the market as well.

I work with one of the best appraisers in the Midwest, and he recently put together a thorough report about matched pairs. He wrote a report that compared five properties to five similar properties. That brings us back to the term matched pairs. **These “matched pairs” were then compared to each other.**

Half of the properties had minimal fixes. The other half were situations where the owner put in a significant amount of money to improve the home before selling. Some of the owners put in as much as $25,000.

The homes that had money put in to make significant improvements ended up selling a lot quicker and for a lot more money. &nbsp;Some owners invested $25,000 and ended up selling the home for $50,000 more than the owner who only put $5,000 into their home. **A lot of those homes that weren’t invested in too much probably sat on the market for quite a while due to price adjustments.**

If you have any questions for me or you’re thinking of putting your home on the market anytime soon, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you soon.
