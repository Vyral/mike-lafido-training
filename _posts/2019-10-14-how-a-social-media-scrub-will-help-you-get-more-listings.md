If you’re working with a potential prospect, how can you make sure that you’re prepared for your appointment? We’ll take a closer look at that today.&nbsp;

After the phone rings and you’ve set the appointment, what can you do to prepare yourself to increase the probability that you get hired? **A great place to start is with a social media scrub.**

Have you ever Googled yourself? Chances are that your prospective buyer has already Googled you before your meeting. **You should look them up on Google and other social media platforms as well.** See if you can find out some of their likes and interests. I’m not telling you to stalk them, but it’s important to note your similar interests and similar connections to build a better rapport.

Be prepared as you can be. Theodore Roosevelt once said, “Nobody cares how much you know until they know you care.” **If you can make a connection, build rapport, and mirror them, you’ll increase your probability and your conversion rate is going to skyrocket.&nbsp;**

Be authentic, be in the moment, and listen during the appointment. Don’t just talk about the features of hiring you, talk about the benefits. The most listened-to radio station by a potential client is, “What’s in it for me?” The radio station that you need to be listening to is AAT, or “All about them.”
