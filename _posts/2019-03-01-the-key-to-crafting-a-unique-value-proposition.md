To be a successful agent, it’s very important that you develop a unique value proposition.

What’s a unique value proposition? **It’s a simple, concise statement that explains why someone should hire you instead of the competition.**

To help explain why this is so important, whenever I’m at a speaking event or a guest on other people’s podcasts, I like to ask agents which radio station is the most popular among consumers (i.e., buyers and sellers). The answer? WIIFM (“What’s In It for Me?”)

In other words, **the only thing consumers care about is what you can do for them.** If you’re representing a seller, for instance, the only thing they care about is whether you can sell their home quickly and for the most money possible.

Keep that in mind when you’re creating your unique value proposition. Also, remember to emphasize benefits over features. An example of a feature is an award you may have won. A benefit, on the other hand, is something that’s consumer-driven—often by analytical data.

**A unique value proposition is the foundation of any good marketing plan.** If you don’t know your unique value proposition, that’s OK. Talk to your peers, your broker/owner, or your coach (if you have one) to help you figure it out. To get a better understanding of how to benefit the consumer, I also recommend listening to the radio station AAT (“All About Them”).

Last I checked, there are roughly 1.4 million active real estate agents all across the country, so ask yourself: Why should the consumer hire you versus the competition?

If you have any questions about crafting your unique value proposition or there’s anything else I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you. And remember—it’s not the market, it’s the marketing.
