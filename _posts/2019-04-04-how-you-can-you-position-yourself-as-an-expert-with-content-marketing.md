One of the chief strategies for attracting more clients to your business is through **content marketing**, and that’s the topic for discussion today. 

Content marketing can be defined in a few different ways; it can take the form of educational videos that you promote on your YouTube channel, blog, or website, or maybe you write articles for outside publications or your own blog and/or website that is oriented toward your subject matter.  

**Whichever form it takes, it should demonstrate the extent of your knowledge to consumers. **

Let’s consider some examples centered around content marketing: 

* Tips for buyers 
* Tips for sellers 
* Real estate market updates 
* Commonly asked questions that you, as the agent, receive
* Specific neighborhood highlights 

**Effectively leveraging content marketing through any of these avenues will position you as a leading authority in your given market**. To that end, having a presence on social media or anywhere online will naturally magnetize people in your market to you.
