Lifestyle is very important when you sell home - but what exactly does that mean?

The traditional marketing method of putting pictures of homes online just isn't going to cut it anymore. Videos bring a whole new dimension to the selling process, but only 2% of agents are using it to market homes! Of that 2%, NONE OF THEM use lifestyle videos like we do.

Most agents, if they're using videos, are only posting YouTube videos made up of a succession of still photographs. Recently, we just broke the record for the highest sale price in Wheaton history because we take marketing to another level. Before we came along, the home sat on the market for an entire year and had the price reduced by as much as half a million dollars. Once we got the listing, we sold the home for record price in only 79 days!

So, how did lifestyle marketing get this home sold? The truth is only 10% of buyers can visualize whereas 90% of people can only see the home as it is. This is why staging is so crucial in real estate nowadays. But lifestyle marketing goes beyond just staging; it's all about accentuating the best features of the home to show the buyer all the opportunities the property affords.
