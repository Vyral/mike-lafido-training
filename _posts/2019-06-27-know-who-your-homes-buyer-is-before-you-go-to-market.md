Who is your buyer?

When asking this question, I like to use the term “avatar” in reference to the buyer. As a listing agent, you need to figure out who your avatar is before you go to market, so you can position your home to appeal to a larger pool of buyers. Remember we talked about this very subject, and knowing your avatar is a part of the positioning process.&nbsp;

**Your avatar can take many different forms**—it might be someone with kids, someone who’s downsizing or relocating, someone who’s interested in new construction, etc. In any case, you need to figure out who your avatar is before you make the listing go live on the market.&nbsp;

{% include pullquote.html %}<br><br>There’s a reason why one of the modules in our Luxury Listing Specialist Certification is all about the property launch, and this is because that’s when the heavy lifting happens—from the time you sign the listing agreement to the time the home goes live on the MLS. Here, you’re doing all the necessary prep work to position the home so that the maximum pool of buyers can visualize living in it.&nbsp;

**So figure out your avatar and position all of your marketing efforts (your terminology, description, photos, videos, database, etc.) toward the agents and buyers who you think apply to that avatar.** You might be wrong in some cases—you can’t be all things to all people—but you should position your home to appeal to the majority of people who represent your avatar.&nbsp;

Also, remember to be aware of the Fair Housing Act when choosing your language, and if you’re unsure of something, check with your broker/owner.&nbsp;

As always, if you have any questions about this or any other topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. And remember—it’s not the market, it’s the marketing.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
